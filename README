Zimlet template
================

This package is a template for creating zimlets.

Getting started:

    * choose a name for the zimlets and correct the filenames:
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template directory
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template/src/biz_vnc_template.* files
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template/Makefile: variable ZIMLET_NAME

    * user-visible texts (eg. label and description) are stored in
      the translation property files

    * all files in zimlets/$(ZIMLET_NAME)/src will be packed into zipfile

    * in the xml file, the symbols @ZIMLET_NAME@, @ZIMLET_VERSION@ and
      will be replaced by the according Makefile variables

    * the version number comes from conf.mk

    * for development/testing builds, the environment variable $VERSION_SUFFIX
      should be set to produce special versions without changing the code


Building java libraries: (without ant)

    * include zcs-java-lib.mk
    * Variables:
    ** *ZCS_LIB_JARS*:    specify additional jar's for building (standard libs in $ZIMBRA_ROOT/lib/jars/ are automatically included)
    ** *JAR_FILE_NAME*:   name of the resulting jar file
    ** *INSTALL_USER*:    set to y to install the jar into the user frontend container
    ** *INSTALL_ADMIN*:   set to y to install the jar into the admin frontend container
